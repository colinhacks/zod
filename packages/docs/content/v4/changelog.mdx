> To learn more about the performance enhancements and new features of Zod 4, read the [introductory post](/v4).

This migration guide aims to list the breaking changes in Zod 4 in order of highest to lowest impact. Every effort was made to prevent breaking changes, but some are unavoidable.

<Callout>
**Note** — Zod 3 exported a large number of undocumented, internal utility types and functions that are not considered part of the public API. Changes to those are not documented here.
</Callout>


To install the beta:

```
npm upgrade zod@next
```

## Error customization

This is perhaps the most visible of the removed APIs. Zod 4 standardizes the APIs for error customization under a single, unified `error` param. 

### deprecates `message`

Replace `message` with `error`. The `message` parameter is still supported but deprecated.

<Tabs groupId="error-message" items={["Zod 4", "Zod 3"]} persist>
<Tab value="Zod 4">
```ts
z.string().min(5, { error: "Too short." });
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Zod 3">
```ts
z.string().min(5, { message: "Too short." });
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### drops `invalid_type_error` and `required_error`

The `invalid_type_error` / `required_error` params have been dropped. These were hastily added years ago as a way to customize errors that was less verbose than `errorMap`. They came with all sorts of footguns (they can't be used in conjunction with `errorMap`) and do not align with Zod's actual issue codes (there is no `required` issue code). 

These can now be cleanly represented with the new `error` parameter. 

<Tabs groupId="error-type" items={["Zod 4", "Zod 3"]} persist>
<Tab value="Zod 4">
```ts
z.string({ 
  error: (issue) => issue.input === undefined 
    ? "This field is required" 
    : "Not a string" 
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Zod 3">
```ts
z.string({ 
  required_error: "This field is required",
  invalid_type_error: "Not a string", 
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### drops `errorMap`

This is renamed to `error`. Error maps can also now return a string or `undefined` (which yields control to the next error map in the chain).

<Tabs groupId="error-map" items={["Zod 4", "Zod 3"]} persist>
<Tab value="Zod 4">
```ts
z.string({
  error: (issue) => {
    if (issue.code === "too_small") {
      return `Value must be >${issue.minimum}`
    }
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Zod 3">
```ts
z.string({
  errorMap: (issue, ctx) => {
    if (issue.code === "too_small") {
      return { message: `Value must be >${issue.minimum}` };
    }
    return { message: ctx.defaultError };
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## `ZodError`

### no longer extends `Error`

It is very slow to instantiate `Error` instances in JavaScript, as the initialization process snapshots the call stack. The magnitude of this performance hit is too much to justify, and extending `Error` adds little value anyway. The `.stack` trace includes lots of Zod internals and can be confusing. 

In Zod 4 the `ZodError` class no longer extends the plain JavaScript `Error` class. Instead, `ZodError` `implements` the `Error` interface. This means all error-handling code should still work with the exception of `instanceof Error` checks. 

```ts
try {
  z.string().parse(data)
} catch(err) {
  if (err instanceof z.ZodError) {
    // handle ZodError
  }
  
  if (err instanceof Error) {
    // handle regular Error
  }
}
```

### updates issue formats

The issue formats have been dramatically streamlined. 

```ts
import * as z from "zod"; // v4

type IssueFormats = 
  | z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidType
  | z.core.$ZodIssueTooBig
  | z.core.$ZodIssueTooSmall
  | z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidStringFormat
  | z.core.$ZodIssueNotMultipleOf
  | z.core.$ZodIssueUnrecognizedKeys
  | z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidValue
  | z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidUnion
  | z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidKey // new: used for z.record/z.map 
  | z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidElement // new: used for z.map/z.set
  | z.core.$ZodIssueCustom;
```

Below is the list of Zod 3 issues types and their Zod 4 equivalent:

```ts
import * as z from "zod"; // v3

export type IssueFormats =
  | z.ZodInvalidTypeIssue // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidType
  | z.ZodTooBigIssue  // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueTooBig
  | z.ZodTooSmallIssue // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueTooSmall
  | z.ZodInvalidStringIssue // ♻️ z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidStringFormat
  | z.ZodNotMultipleOfIssue // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueNotMultipleOf
  | z.ZodUnrecognizedKeysIssue // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueUnrecognizedKeys
  | z.ZodInvalidUnionIssue // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidUnion
  | z.ZodCustomIssue // ♻️ renamed to z.core.$ZodIssueCustom
  | z.ZodInvalidEnumValueIssue // ❌ merged in z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidValue
  | z.ZodInvalidLiteralIssue // ❌ merged into z.core.$ZodIssueInvalidValue
  | z.ZodInvalidUnionDiscriminatorIssue // ❌ throws an Error at schema creation time
  | z.ZodInvalidArgumentsIssue // ❌ z.function throws ZodError directly
  | z.ZodInvalidReturnTypeIssue // ❌ z.function throws ZodError directly
  | z.ZodInvalidDateIssue // ❌ merged into invalid_type
  | z.ZodInvalidIntersectionTypesIssue // ❌ removed (throws regular Error)
  | z.ZodNotFiniteIssue // ❌ infinite values no longer accepted (invalid_type)
```

While certain Zod 4 issue types have been merged, dropped, and modified, each issue remains structurally similar to Zod 3 counterpart (identical, in most cases). All issues still conform to the same base interface as Zod 3, so most common error handling logic will work without modification.

```ts
export interface $ZodIssueBase {
  readonly code?: string;
  readonly input?: unknown;
  readonly path: PropertyKey[];
  readonly message: string;
}
```

### changes error map precedence

The error map precedence has been changed to be more consistent. Specifically, an error map passed into `.parse()` *no longer* takes precedence over a schema-level error map.

```ts
const mySchema = z.string({ error: () => "Schema-level error" });

// in Zod 3
mySchema.parse(12, { error: () => "Contextual error" }); // => "Contextual error"

// in Zod 4
mySchema.parse(12, { error: () => "Contextual error" }); // => "Schema-level error"
```

### deprecates `.format()` 

The `.format()` method on `ZodError` has been deprecated. Instead use the top-level `z.treeifyError()` function. Read the [Formatting errors docs](/error-formatting) for more information. 

### deprecates `.flatten()`

The `.flatten()` method on `ZodError` has also been deprecated. Instead use the top-level `z.treeifyError()` function. Read the [Formatting errors docs](/error-formatting) for more information. 

### drops `.formErrors` 

This API was identical to `.flatten()`. It exists for historical reasons and isn't documented.

### deprecates `.addIssue()` and `.addIssues()`

Directly push to `err.issues` array instead, if necessary.

```ts
myError.issues.push({ 
  // new issue
});
```

{/* ## `.and()` dropped

The `.and()` method on `ZodType` has been dropped in favor of `z.intersection(A, B)`. Not only is this method rarely used, there are few good reasons to use intersections at all. The `.and()` API prevented bundlers from treeshaking `ZodIntersection`, a fairly large and complex class. 

```ts
z.object({ a: z.string() }).and(z.object({ b: z.number() })); // ❌

// use z.intersection
z.intersection(z.object({ a: z.string() }), z.object({ b: z.number() })); // ✅
// or .extend() when possible
z.object({ a: z.string() }).extend(z.object({ b: z.number() })); // ✅
``` */}

## `z.number()`

### no infinite values

`POSITIVE_INFINITY` and `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` are no longer considered valid values for `z.number()`.

### `.int()` accepts safe integers only

The `z.number().int()` API no longer accepts unsafe integers (outside the range of `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`). Using integers out of this range causes spontaneous rounding errors.


## `z.string()` updates

### deprecates `.email()` etc

String formats are now represented as *subclasses* of `ZodString`, instead of simple internal refinements. As such, these APIs have been moved to the top-level `z` namespace. Top-level APIs are also less verbose and more tree-shakable.

```ts
z.email();
z.uuid();
z.url();
z.emoji();         // validates a single emoji character
z.base64();
z.base64url();
z.nanoid();
z.cuid();
z.cuid2();
z.ulid();
z.ipv4();
z.ipv6();
z.cidrv4();          // ip range
z.cidrv6();          // ip range
z.iso.date();
z.iso.time();
z.iso.datetime();
z.iso.duration();
```

The method forms (`z.string().email()`) still exist and work as before, but are now deprecated.

```ts
z.string().email(); // ❌ deprecated
z.email(); // ✅ 
```

### drops `z.string().ip()` 

This has been replaced with separate `.ipv4()` and `.ipv6()` methods. Use `z.union()` to combine them if you need to accept both.

```ts
z.string().ip() // ❌
z.ipv4() // ✅
z.ipv6() // ✅
```

### updates `z.string().ipv6()`

Validation now happens using the `new URL()` constructor, which is far more robust than the old regular expression approach. Some invalid values that passed validation previously may now fail.

### drops `z.string().cidr()` 

Similarly, this has been replaced with separate `.cidrv4()` and `.cidrv6()` methods. Use `z.union()` to combine them if you need to accept both.

```ts
z.string().cidr() // ❌
z.cidrv4() // ✅
z.cidrv6() // ✅
```

## `z.coerce` updates

The input type of all coerced booleans is now `unknown`. 

```ts
const schema = z.coerce.string();
type schemaInput = z.input<typeof schema>;

// Zod 3: string;
// Zod 4: unknown;
```

## `.default()` updates

The application of `.default()` has changed in a subtle way. 

```ts
T.default(default).parse(input); // where T is some schema
```

In Zod 3, this would be equivalent to:

```ts
// the default value would be parsed by the inner schema
T.parse(input ?? default); 
```

in Zod 4, the default short-circuits the parsing process.

```ts
// 
input === undefined ? default : T.parse(input);
```

To replicate the old behavior, you can use transform and pipe:

```ts
z.transform(val => val ?? default).pipe(T);
```

## `z.object()`

These modifier methods on the `ZodObject` class determine how the schema handles unknown keys. In Zod 4, this functionality now exists in top-level functions. This aligns better with Zod's declarative-first philosophy, and puts all object variants on equal footing. 


### deprecates `.strict()` and `.passthrough()`

These methods are generally no longer necessary. Instead use the top-level `z.strictObject()` and `z.looseObject()` functions.

```ts
// Zod 3
z.object({ name: z.string() }).strict();
z.object({ name: z.string() }).passthrough();

// Zod 4
z.strictObject({ name: z.string() });
z.looseObject({ name: z.string() });
```

> These methods are still available for backwards compatibility, and they will not be removed. They are considered legacy.

### deprecates `.strip()`

This was never particularly useful, as it was the default behavior of `z.object()`. To convert a strict object to a "regular" one, use `z.object(A.shape)`.

### drops `.nonstrict()`

This long-deprecated alias for `.strip()` has been removed.

### drops `.deepPartial()`

This has been long deprecated in Zod 3 and it now removed in Zod 4. There is no direct alternative to this API. There were lots of footguns in its implementation, and its use is generally an anti-pattern.

### changes `z.unknown()` optionality

The `z.unknown()` and `z.any()` types are no longer marked as "key optional" in the inferred types.

```ts
const mySchema = z.object({
  a: z.any(),
  b: z.unknown()
});
// Zod 3: { a?: any; b?: unknown };
// Zod 4: { a: any; b: unknown };
```

## `z.nativeEnum()` deprecated

The `z.nativeEnum()` function is now deprecated in favor of just `z.enum()`. The `z.enum()` API has been overloaded to support an enum-like input.

```ts
enum Color {
  Red = "red",
  Green = "green",
  Blue = "blue",
}

const ColorSchema = z.enum(Color); // ✅
```

As part of this refactor of `ZodEnum`, a number of long-deprecated and redundant features have been removed. These were all identical and only existed for historical reasons.

```ts
ColorSchema.enum.Red; // ✅ => "Red" (canonical API)
ColorSchema.Enum.Red; // ❌ removed
ColorSchema.Values.Red; // ❌ removed
```

## `z.array()`

### changes `.nonempty()` type

This now behaves identically to `z.array().min(1)`. The inferred type does not change.

```ts
const NonEmpty = z.array(z.string()).nonempty();

type NonEmpty = z.infer<typeof NonEmpty>; 
// Zod 3: [string, ...string[]]
// Zod 4: string[]
```

The old behavior is now better represented with `z.tuple()` and a "rest" argument. This aligns more closely to TypeScript's type system.

```ts
z.tuple([z.string()], z.string());
// => [string, ...string[]]
```

## `z.promise()` deprecated

There's rarely a reason to use `z.promise()`. If you have an input that may be a `Promise`, just `await` it before parsing it with Zod.

> If you are using `z.promise` to define an async function with `z.function()`, that's no longer necessary either; see the [`ZodFunction`](#function) section below.

## `z.function()`

The result of `z.function()` is no longer a Zod schema. Instead, it acts as a standalone "function factory" for defining Zod-validated functions. The API has also changed; you define an `input` and `output` schema upfront, instead of using `args()` and `.returns()` methods.

<Tabs groupId="lib" items={["Zod 4", "Zod 3"]} persist>
<Tab value="Zod 4">
```ts
const myFunction = z.function({
  input: [z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number().int(),
  })],
  output: z.string(),
});

myFunction.implement((input) => {
  return `Hello ${input.name}, you are ${input.age} years old.`;
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Zod 3">
```ts
const myFunction = z.function()
  .args(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number().int(),
  }))
  .returns(z.string());

myFunction.implement((input) => {
  return `Hello ${input.name}, you are ${input.age} years old.`;
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### adds `.implementAsync()`

To define an async function, use `implementAsync()` instead of `implement()`. 

```ts
myFunction.implementAsync(async (input) => {
  return `Hello ${input.name}, you are ${input.age} years old.`;
});
```

## `.refine()`

### ignores type predicates

In Zod 3, passing a [type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates) as a refinement functions could still narrow the type of a schema. This wasn't documented but was discussed in some issues. This is no longer the case.

```ts
const mySchema = z.unknown().refine((val): val is string => {
  return typeof val === "string"
});

type MySchema = z.infer<typeof mySchema>; 
// Zod 3: `string`
// Zod 4: still `unknown`
```

## `z.ostring()`, etc dropped

The undocumented convenience methods `z.ostring()`, `z.onumber()`, etc. have been removed. These were shorthand methods for defining optional string schemas.

## `z.literal()` drops `symbol` support

Symbols aren't considered literal values, nor can they be simply compared with `===`. This was an oversight in Zod 3.

## `.create()` factories dropped

Previously all Zod classes defined a static `.create()` method. These are now implemented as standalone factory functions.

```ts
z.ZodString.create(); // ❌ 
```

## `z.discriminatedUnion()`

You no longer need to specify a discriminator key (though you still can if you wish; it is ignored).

```ts
// in Zod 4:
const myUnion = z.discriminatedUnion([
  z.object({ type: z.literal("a"), a: z.string() }),
  z.object({ type: z.literal("b"), b: z.number() }),
]);

// in Zod 3:
const myUnion = z.discriminatedUnion("type", [
  z.object({ type: z.literal("a"), a: z.string() }),
  z.object({ type: z.literal("b"), b: z.number() }),
]);
```

## `z.record()`

### drops single argument usage

Before, `z.record()` could be used with a single argument. This is no longer supported. 

```ts
// Zod 3
z.record(z.string()); // ✅

// Zod 4
z.record(z.string()); // ❌
z.record(z.string(), z.string()); // ✅
```

### improves enum support

Records have gotten a lot smarter. In Zod 3, passing an enum into `z.record()` as a key schema would result in a partial type

```ts
const myRecord = z.record(z.enum(["a", "b", "c"]), z.number()); 
// { a?: number; b?: number; c?: number; }
```

In Zod 4, this is no longer the case. The inferred type is what you'd expect, and Zod ensures exhaustiveness; that is, it makes sure all enum keys exist in the input during parsing.

```ts
const myRecord = z.record(z.enum(["a", "b", "c"]), z.number());
// { a: number; b: number; c: number; }
```

## `z.intersection()`


### throws `Error` on merge conflict

Zod intersection parses the input against two schemas, then attempts to merge the results. In Zod 3, when the results were unmergable, Zod threw a `ZodError` with a special `"invalid_intersection_types"` issue. 

In Zod 4, this will throw a regular `Error` instead. The existence of unmergable results indicates a structural problem with the schema: an intersection of two incompatible types. Thus, a regular error is more appropriate than a validation error. 






















## Internal changes

> The typical user of Zod can likely ignore everything below this line. These changes do not impact the user-facing `z` APIs. 

There are too many internal changes to list here, but some may be relevant to regular users who are (intentionally or not) relying on certain implementation details. These changes will be of particular interest to library authors building tools on top of Zod.

### updates generics

The generic structure of several classes has changed. Perhaps most significant is the change to the `ZodType` base class:

```ts
// Zod 3
class ZodType<Output, Def extends z.ZodTypeDef, Input = Output> {
  // ...
}

// Zod 4
class ZodType<Output = unknown, Input = unknown> {
  // ...
}
```

The second generic `Def` has been entirely removed. Instead the base class now only tracks `Output` and `Input`. While previously the `Input` value defaulted to `Output`, it now defaults to `unknown`. This allows generic functions involving `z.ZodType` to behave more intuitively in many cases.

```ts
function inferSchema<T extends z.ZodType>(schema: T): T {
  return schema;
};

inferSchema(z.string()); // z.ZodString
```

The need for `z.ZodTypeAny` has been eliminated; just use `z.ZodType` instead.


### adds `z.core`

Many utility functions and types have been moved to the new `@zod/core` package, to facilitate code sharing between `zod` and `@zod/mini`. The contents of `@zod/core` from `zod`/`@zod/mini` using the `z.core` namespace. Check `z.core` if any internal APIs you rely on are missing; they've likely been moved there.

```ts
import * as z from "zod";

function handleError(iss: z.core.utils.$ZodError) {
  // do stuff
}
```

### moves `._def`

The `._def` property is now moved to `._zod.def`. The structure of all internal defs is subject to change; this is relevant to library authors but won't be comprehensively documented here.


{/* The core library also implements the base classes of all schemas (`$ZodType` base class, plus `$ZodString`, `$ZodNumber`, etc), utility functions/types, issue types (`$ZodIssueInvalidType`, etc.), and the base error class (`$ZodError`). If you are building on top of Zod, using the core classes is recommended over using the `zod`-specific classes like (`ZodType`, `ZodString`, etc.). */}

{/* ## The `@zod/core` package

A new `@zod/mini` package is being released concurrently with Zod 4. This is a new package optimized for tree-shakability and intended for use in bundle-size-constrained applications. 

To facilitate code sharing, both `zod` and `@zod/mini` have a dependency on a new common core library called `@zod/core`. This library implements the base classes of all schemas (`$ZodType` base class, plus `$ZodString`, `$ZodNumber`, etc), utility functions/types, issue types (`$ZodIssueInvalidType`, etc.), and the base error class (`$ZodError`).

As you can see these things are all prefixed with `$` to indicate they are implemented in `@zod/core`. Many things formerly exported from `zod` have been moved to `@zod/core`. You can access the contents of `@zod/core` from `zod`/`@zod/mini` using the `z.core` namespace.

```ts
import * as z from "zod";

function handleIssue(iss: z.core.$ZodIssue) {
  // do stuff
}
``` */}

### drops `ZodEffects`

This doesn't affect the user-facing APIs, but it's an internal change worth highlighting. It's part of a larger restructure of how Zod handles *refinements*. 

Previously both refinements and transformations lived inside a wrapper class called `ZodEffects`. That means adding either one to a schema would wrap the original schema in a `ZodEffects` instance. In Zod 4, refinements now live inside the schemas themselves. More accurately, each schema contains an array of "checks"; the concept of a "check" is new in Zod 4 and generalizes the concept of a refinement to include potentially side-effectful transforms like `z.toLowerCase()`. 

This is particularly apparent in the `@zod/mini` API, which heavily relies on the `.check()` method to compose various validations together.

```ts
import * as z from "@zod/mini";

z.string().check(
  z.minLength(10),
  z.maxLength(100),
  z.toLowerCase(),
  z.trim(),
);
```

### adds `ZodTransform`

Meanwhile, transforms have been moved into a dedicated `ZodTransform` class. This schema class represents an input transform; in fact, you can actually define standalone transformations now:

```ts
import * as z from "zod";

const schema = z.transform(input => String(input));

schema.parse(12); // => "12"
```

This is primarily used in conjunction with `ZodPipe`. The `.transform()` method now returns an instance of `ZodPipe`.

```ts
z.string().transform(val => val); // ZodPipe<ZodString, ZodTransform>
```

### drops `ZodPreprocess`

As with `.transform()`, the `z.preprocess()` function now returns a `ZodPipe` instance instead of a dedicated `ZodPreprocess` instance.

```ts
z.preprocess(val => val, z.string()); // ZodPipe<ZodTransform, ZodString>
```

### drops `ZodBranded`

Branding is now handled with a direct modification to the inferred type, instead of a dedicated `ZodBranded` class. The user-facing APIs remain the same.


{/* - Dropping support for ES5
  - Zod relies on `Set` internally */}

{/* - ZodObject `.keyof()` now returns `ZodLiteral` not `ZodEnum` */}



{/* ## Changed: `.refine()`

The `.refine()` method used to accept a function as the second argument. 

```ts
// no longer supported
const longString = z.string().refine(
  (val) => val.length > 10,
  (val) => ({ message: `${val} is not more than 10 characters` })
);
```

This can be better represented with the new `error` parameter, so this overload has been removed.

```ts
const longString = z.string().refine((val) => val.length > 10, {
  error: (issue) => `${issue.input} is not more than 10 characters`,
});
``
 */}


{/* 
- No support for `null` or `undefined` in `z.literal`
  - `z.literal(null)`
  - `z.literal(undefined)`
  - this was never documented */}


{/* - Array min/max/length checks now run after parsing. This means they won't run if the parse has already aborted. */}



{/* - Drops single-argument `z.record()` */}
{/* - Smarter `z.record`: no longer Partial by default */}

{/* - Intersection merge errors are now thrown as Error not ZodError
  - These usually do not reflect a parse error but a structural problem with the schema */}
{/* - Consolidates `unknownKeys` and `catchall` in ZodObject */}
{/* - Dropping
  - `ZodBranded`: purely a static-domain annotation
  - `ZodFunction` */}
{/* - The `description` is now stored in `z.defaultRegistry`, not the def
  - No support for `description` in factory params
  - Descriptions do not cascade in `.optional()`, etc */}
{/* - Enums:
  - ZodEnum and ZodNativeEnum are merged
  - `.Values` and `.Enum` are removed. Use `.enum` instead.
  - `.options` is removed */}
