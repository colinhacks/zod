## Do I need to depend on Zod?

First things first, make sure you need to depend on Zod at all. 

If you're building a library that accepts user-defined schemas to perform black-box validation, you may not need to integrate with Zod specifically. Instead look into [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/). It's a shared interface implemented by most popular validation libraries in the TypeScript ecosystem (see the [full list](https://standardschema.dev/#what-schema-libraries-implement-the-spec)), including Zod. 

This spec works great if you accept user-defined schemas and treat them like "black box" validators. Given any compliant library, you can extract inferred input/output types, validate inputs, and get back a standardized error.

If you need Zod specific functionality, read on.

## How to configure peer dependencies?

Any library built on top of Zod should include `"zod"` in `"peerDependencies"`. This lets your users "bring their own Zod".

```json
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "peerDependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.25.0"
  }
}
```

During development, you need to meet your own peer dependency requirement, to do so, add `"zod"` to your `"devDependencies"` as well.

```ts
// package.json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.25.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.25.0"
  }
}
```

## How to support Zod 4?

To support Zod 4, update the minimum version for your `"zod"` peer dependency to `^3.25.0`. 

```json
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "peerDependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.25.0"
  }
}
```

Starting with `v3.25.0`, Zod 4 is available at a `/v4` subpath. 

```ts
import * as z4 from "zod/v4/core";
```

Library code should *not* import from the package root (`"zod"`)! Instead, import from the version-specific subpaths: `"zod/v3"` and `"zod/v4/core"`. This way, your code is future-proofed against major version bumps down the line.

## How to support Zod 3 and Zod 4 simultaneously?

Starting in `v3.25.0`, the package contains copies of both Zod 3 and Zod 4 at their respective subpaths. This makes it easy to support both versions simultaneously.

```ts
import * as z3 from "zod/v3";
import * as z4 from "zod/v4/core";

type Schema = z3.ZodTypeAny | z4.$ZodType;

function acceptUserSchema(schema: z3.ZodTypeAny | z4.$ZodType) {
  // ...
}
```

To differentiate between Zod 3 and Zod 4 schemas at runtime, check for the `"_zod"` property. This property is only defined on Zod 4 schemas.

```ts
import type * as z3 from "zod/v3";
import type * as v4 from "zod/v4/core";

declare const schema: z3.ZodTypeAny | v4.$ZodType;

if ("_zod" in schema) {
  schema._zod.def; // Zod 4 schema
} else {
  schema._def; // Zod 3 schema
}
```

## How to support Zod and Zod Mini simultaneously?

Your library code should only import from `zod/v4/core`. This sub-package defines the interfaces, classes, and utilities that are shared between `zod/v4` and `zod/v4-mini`. 

```ts
// library code
import * as z from "zod/v4/core";

export function acceptObjectSchema<T extends z.$ZodObject>(schema: T){
  // parse data
  z.parse(schema, { /* somedata */});
  // inspect internals
  schema._zod.def.shape;
}
```

By building against the shared base interfaces, you can reliably support both sub-packages simultaneously. This function can accept both `zod/v4` and `zod/v4-mini` schemas. 

```ts
// user code
import { acceptObjectSchema } from "your-library";

// Zod 4
import * as z from "zod/v4";
acceptObjectSchema(z.object({ name: z.string() }));

// Zod 4 Mini
import * as zm from "zod/v4-mini";
acceptObjectSchema(zm.object({ name: zm.string() }))
```

Refer to the [Zod Core](/packages/core) page for more information on the contents of the core sub-library.

{/* ### Future proofing

To future-proof your library, your code should always allow for new schema and check classes to be added in the future. The addition of a new schema type is *not* considered a breaking change. 

One common pattern when introspecting Zod schemas is to write a switch statement over the set of first-party schema types:

```ts
const schema = {} as z.$ZodTypes;
const def = schema._zod.def;
switch (def.type) {
  case "string":
    // ...
    break;
  case "object":
    // ...
    break;
  default:
    console.warn(`Unknown schema type: ${def.type}`);
    // reasonable fallback behavior
}
```

To future-proof this code, your `default` case should probably not throw an error. Instead, it should print an informative error and fall back to some reasonable behavior. If instead you `throw` an error in the default case, your library will be unusable if/when new schemas types are added in the future. Best to print a warning and treat it as a "no-op" (or some other reasonable fallback behavior). The same applies to unrecognized check types, string formats, etc.

## How to accept user-defined schemas?

Accepting user-defined schemas is the a fundamental operation for any library built on Zod. This section outlines the best practices for doing so.

When starting out, it may be tempting to write a function that accepts a Zod schema like this:

```ts
import * as z from "zod/v4";

function inferSchema<T>(schema: z.core.$ZodType<T>) {
  return schema;
}
```

This approach is incorrect, and limits TypeScript's ability to properly infer the argument. No matter what you pass in, the type of `schema` will be an instance of `ZodType`. 

```ts
inferSchema(z.string());
// => z.core.$ZodType<string>
```

This approach loses type information, namely _which subclass_ the input actually is (in this case, `ZodString`). That means you can't call any string-specific methods like `.min()` on the result of `inferSchema`. Instead, your generic parameter should extend the core Zod schema interface:

```ts
function inferSchema<T extends z.core.$ZodType>(schema: T) {
  return schema;
}

inferSchema(z.string());
// => ZodString
```

To constrain the input schema to a specific subclass:

```ts

import * as z from "zod/v4";

// only accepts object schemas
function inferSchema<T>(schema: z.core.$ZodObject) {
  return schema;
}
```

To constrain the inferred output type of the input schema:

```ts

import * as z from "zod/v4";

// only accepts string schemas
function inferSchema<T extends z.core.$ZodType<string>>(schema: T) {
  return schema;
}

inferSchema(z.string()); // ✅ 

inferSchema(z.number()); 
// ❌ The types of '_zod.output' are incompatible between these types. 
// // Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```

To parse data with the schema, use the top-level `z.parse`/`z.safeParse`/`z.parseAsync`/`z.safeParseAsync` functions. The `z.core.$ZodType` subclass has no methods on it. The usual parsing methods are implemented by Zod and Zod Mini, but are not available in Zod Core.

```ts
function parseData<T extends z.core.$ZodType>(data: unknown, schema: T): z.output<T> {
  return z.parse(schema, data);
}

parseData("sup", z.string());
// => string
```
